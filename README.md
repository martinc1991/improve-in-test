## Introduction

This is an React app that consumes a Bands API from _My JSON Server_. It was made following [these instructions](https://github.com/improvein/dev-challenge/tree/master/frontend-react).

## How to run the project

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies

```js
// clone
git clone https://github.com/martinc1991/improve-in-test.git
```

2. Go to the _root folder_ (the folder created in the previous step) and install dependencies

```js
// in the root folder
npm install
```

3. Finally, simply run the next command in the _root folder_:

```js
// root folder
npm start
```

## Notes

- Since the challenge wasnÂ´t about making a great UI, I just added Bootstrap to make it easier to get a decent UI (also, i didn't make it responsive yet).

## To-Do List

- Add spinners to show while the app is loading info form the server.
- Add icons to the sorting buttons.
- Make it responsive.
